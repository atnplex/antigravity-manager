# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

We provide security updates for the following versions:

| Version | Supported |
|--------|-----------|
| Latest stable release | ✅ |
| Older releases | ❌ |
| `main` / pre-release builds | ❌ (best-effort only) |

> If you are unsure which version you are running, include the app version and commit SHA (if available) in your report.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please do not open a public GitHub Issue for security vulnerabilities.

Instead, report vulnerabilities privately using GitHub Security Advisories:
https://github.com/atnplex/antigravity-manager/security/advisories/new

If you do not see “Report a vulnerability”, private vulnerability reporting may not be enabled for this repository.

### What to include

To help us triage quickly, please include:
- A clear description of the issue and potential impact
- Affected component(s) and version(s)
- Reproduction steps or a proof of concept (PoC)
- Any relevant logs, screenshots, crash reports, or stack traces
- Your environment (OS, architecture, deployment mode, config flags)
- Whether the issue is publicly known or already being exploited (if you know)

## Our Response Process

We aim to:
- Acknowledge receipt within 2 business days
- Provide an initial triage assessment within 7 days
- Work toward a fix within 90 days for confirmed, high-impact issues

Timelines may vary based on severity, complexity, and release constraints.

## Coordinated Disclosure

We ask that you:
- Keep the report private until we ship a fix or agree on a disclosure date
- Avoid accessing data that isn’t yours or impacting real users/systems

If you want public credit, tell us what name/handle to use.

## Safe Harbor (Good-Faith Security Research)

We support good-faith research that:
- Avoids privacy violations, data destruction, and service disruption
- Uses test accounts/systems where possible
- Stops once the vulnerability is confirmed
